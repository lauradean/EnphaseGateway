This plugin is for displaying the production and consumption data for solar panel installation. To use, you will need a user login for Enlighten and a developer API key for Enphase Storage.

Log in to Enlighten here:
https://enlighten.enphaseenergy.com/

Acquire your developer API key here:
https://developer.enphase.com/

Once plugin is activated, a menu will appear in the WordPress control panel. Click the Authorization URL to generate your user_id. You can find your site ID on the Enlighten support page.

Just enter your user ID, API key, site ID, and the number of days you wish to display into the control panel, and then enter the shorttag '[enphase]' on any post or page to display the graph of energy production and consumption. This plugin uses Google Charts to create the bar graph.
